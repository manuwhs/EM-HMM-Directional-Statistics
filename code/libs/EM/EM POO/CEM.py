    Inputs:
        - distribution: Distribution manager with the different distributions of the 
        mixture and their associated clusters.
        - clusters_relation: Dependency between the clusters:
              - For "independent": The clusters are assumed independent
              - For "MarkovChain1": The clusters are assumed to follow discrete 
                 MC of order 1
        - delta_ll: Minimum increase in likelihood for consideing that the algorithm 
        has not converged. If in an iteration the incomplete loglikelihood does not 
        increase by this minimum value, the iterations stop.
        - T: Maximum number of iterations.
        - model_theta_init: Initial parameters of the model. If not given they will 
        be initilized uniformly. This is [pi] or [pi, A] for example.
        - theta_init: Initial parameters of the clusters. If not provided, the 
        initializer provided in the
          distribution objects will initialize them.
        - Ninit: Number of random random re-initilizations.
        - verbose: The higher the value, the more partial outputs will be printed out.
            - 0: No verbose
            - 1: Indication of each initilization of the EM and its final ll.
            - 2: Indication of each iteration of the EM and its final ll.
        - time_profiling: If we want to see the times it takes for operations.
        
    Output:
        - logl: List of incomplete loglikelihoods asociated to each iteration.
          Notice it will have always the added initial loglikelihood asociated 
          to the initialization. So maximum it will be "T+1" elements.
        - theta_list: List of the cluster parameters for each of iterations.
        - model_theta_init: List of the model parameters for each of the iterations
